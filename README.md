My DSP experiments using the pyo library and numpy.

For now, there are 4 wavetable bandlimited thru-zero oscillators (`WSine`, `WSaw`, `WSquare` and `WTri`) in `pyosc.py`.

Available notebooks : 
- wavetable_bandlimited_thru_zero_oscillators : A showcase of the oscillators with interpolation between them.
- supersaw : A recreation of the supersaw synth.
- thru_zero_FM : A demonstration of thru zero FM technique with interpolated modulators and carriers.
